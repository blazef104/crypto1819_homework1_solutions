# Solutions for the homeworks of the cryptography course @ Sapienza AY 18/19

**Disclaimer:** These solutions are developed together with other students, however the final file in this repo represents my personal view of the homework.

A simple `make` in the cloned folder should be able to compile the document in any machine. The only dependency is rubber (and pdftk for page enumeration but is not mandatory).

If you are not confortable with LaTex, command line or whatever check out [Gummi](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi)
